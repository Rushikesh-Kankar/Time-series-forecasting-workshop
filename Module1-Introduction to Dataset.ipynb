This workshop is designed with researchers in mind, to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of time series data, its characteristics, challenges, and the various machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast this type of data.\n","\n","## Why Time Series Analysis?\n","\n","As researchers, you often encounter data that unfolds over time - whether it be tracking disease spread in public health, monitoring climate change indicators in environmental studies, analyzing economic trends, or understanding behavioral patterns in social sciences. The ability to make accurate predictions based on historical data is a crucial tool in a researcher's arsenal.\n","\n","Time series data is distinctive as it brings along its unique characteristics - trend, seasonality, autocorrelation, and more. The chronological order of observations carries meaningful information and ignoring the temporal dependence could lead to misleading insights.\n","\n","## Our Case Study: Walmart Sales Forecasting\n","\n","To make this learning process practical and relevant, we will be using the M5 Forecasting dataset from Kaggle in our case study. It contains daily sales data for various products from Walmart, collected over several years. The dataset is an excellent example of real-world time series data with its complexities and challenges, such as multiple seasonality, presence of trends, and impact of external factors like price and promotions.\n","\n","While this dataset is focused on sales forecasting, the techniques and methodologies we will explore are highly transferrable and can be applied to various research fields:\n","\n","1. **Public Health**: In studying disease spread and the impact of health interventions, time series analysis can be used for forecasting future cases and evaluating intervention strategies.\n","2. **Environmental Studies**: Predicting future climate variables or environmental changes, understanding their patterns and trends, all require dealing with time series data.\n","3. **Economics**: Economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment rates, and many more, are typically time series data. Forecasting these indicators can provide vital insights for policy-making and economic planning.\n","4. **Social Sciences**: In studying human behavior over time, researchers often encounter time series data. Whether it's monitoring social trends or predicting future behaviors, time series analysis techniques are invaluable.\n","\n","By the end of this workshop, you will not only gain an understanding of time series data and forecasting techniques but also acquire hands-on experience with a real-world dataset, using Python and its powerful libraries. You'll leave equipped with a new set of tools to bring to your own research, regardless of your field of study.\n","\n","Let's start our time series exploration journey.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aT7lFLiUtd1t"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","# Features of Time Series Data\n","\n","Time series data is unique because it changes over time, meaning the sequence of data points is important. Here are some special features of time series data:\n","\n","1. **Trend**: Sometimes data can increase or decrease over time. This is called a trend.\n","\n","2. **Seasonality**: Sometimes data can show a repeating pattern at regular intervals. This is called seasonality. An example is sales of ice cream increasing in the summer months every year.\n","\n","3. **Cyclical Patterns**: Sometimes data can rise and fall, but not in a regular pattern. This is a cyclical pattern. An example could be economic data that goes through periods of growth and recession, but not at regular intervals.\n","\n","4. **Noise**: Noise is the random variation in the data that doesn’t fit any pattern.\n","\n","5. **Stationarity**: If a series has a constant mean and variance over time, it is said to be stationary. This means it doesn’t have trend or seasonality. Many models assume that data are stationary.\n","\n","6. **Autocorrelation**: Sometimes, a data point in a series can be correlated with past or future data points. This is called autocorrelation. For example, it might be that a high value today means it's more likely we'll see a high value tomorrow.\n","\n","These features can be used to help us model time series data and make forecasts or predictions for future data points.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JH4pGdAILNOV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dataset Description\n","\n","The M5 dataset, generously made available by Walmart, includes the unit sales of various products sold in the USA, organized in the form of grouped time series.
