The general process of training a machine learning model includes the following steps:\n","\n","1. **Data Preparation**: Before training a model, it is essential to prepare the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling the features. Data preparation ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training the model.\n","\n","2. **Feature Selection**: Feature selection is the process of choosing the most relevant features from the available dataset. It involves identifying the features that have the most impact on the target variable and discarding irrelevant or redundant features. Feature selection helps improve model performance, reduces overfitting, and enhances interpretability.\n","\n","3. **Model Selection**: Model selection involves choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm that best suits the problem at hand. This decision depends on various factors, such as the type of problem (classification, regression, etc.), the nature of the data, and the available computational resources. It is important to select a model that can effectively capture the underlying patterns in the data and make accurate predictions.\n","\n","4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Each machine learning model has hyperparameters that control its behavior and performance. Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the optimal values for these hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. This process often involves techniques like grid search, random search, or more advanced optimization algorithms.\n","\n","5. **Model Training**: Once the data is prepared, features are selected, and hyperparameters are tuned, the model is trained on the training dataset. During the training process, the model learns the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual target values.\n","\n","6. **Model Evaluation**: After the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. This involves using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the problem type. Model evaluation provides insights into how well the model is performing and helps identify potential areas of improvement.\n","\n","7. **Model Validation**: Once the model is evaluated, it is important to validate its performance on unseen data. This is done by applying the trained model to a separate validation dataset or using techniques like cross-validation. Model validation helps assess the generalization ability of the model and ensures that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n","\n","By following these steps, we can train a machine learning model that is capable of making accurate predictions based on the provided data. The model can then be deployed and used to make predictions on new, unseen data for sales forecasting or any other relevant tasks.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"C200jtzijtOY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Scikit-learn (sklearn):** Scikit-learn is a widely-used machine learning library in Python.
