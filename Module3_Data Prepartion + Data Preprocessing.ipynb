Well-engineered features can significantly impact the accuracy and robustness of models, as they provide meaningful representations of the underlying data.\n","\n","There are various techniques and strategies for feature engineering, depending on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. Some common techniques include:\n","\n","1. **Creating Interaction Features:** Interaction features are derived by combining multiple variables or features to capture their combined effect. For example, in a sales dataset, you can create a new feature by multiplying the quantity sold with the price to capture the total sales amount.\n","\n","2. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Categorical variables often need to be encoded into numeric representations for machine learning models. Popular encoding techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding, depending on the nature of the categorical variable and the modeling task.\n","\n","3. **Aggregating Data:** Aggregating data involves summarizing or grouping data at a higher level to extract meaningful insights. For example, in a time-series dataset, you can aggregate sales data at monthly or yearly levels to capture trends and seasonal patterns.\n","\n","4. **Time-based Features:** Time-based features are derived from temporal information, such as date, time, or day of the week. These features can capture recurring patterns, seasonality, or trends in the data. Examples of time-based features include day of the week, month, quarter, or time since a specific event.\n","\n","5. **Transforming Numerical Variables:** Transforming numerical variables can help to normalize their distributions or make them more suitable for modeling. Common transformations include logarithmic transformations, square root transformations, or scaling variables to a specific range.\n","\n","6. **Extracting Text Features:** If your dataset contains text data, feature extraction techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings can be used to convert text into numerical representations that can be used in modeling.\n","\n","It's important to note that feature engineering is an iterative process and may require domain knowledge and experimentation to identify the most informative features for a given problem. Additionally, feature engineering should be done on the training set and then applied consistently to the test or validation sets to maintain consistency.\n","\n","In the upcoming section, we will explore practical examples of feature engineering techniques and demonstrate how they can enhance the predictive power of models or provide valuable insights in data analysis tasks.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"za5Dwk_7ZgA1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Historical Sales Features:"],"metadata":{"id":"CTdAOek-bb_j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Lag Features\n","\n","Lag features are an important technique in time-series analysis, where we leverage the historical values of a variable to predict its future values. In the context of Walmart sales data, lag features involve using the past sales values of a product to predict its future sales. This helps to capture any temporal patterns or dependencies in the data.\n","\n","To create lag features, we shift the sales values of a product by a certain number of time periods. For example, we can create lag features for weekly sales by shifting the sales values one week, two weeks, or more into the past. These lagged values can then be used as additional features in our predictive models.\n","\n","Lag features allow the model to capture patterns such as seasonality, weekly trends, or dependencies on previous sales. By including lag features, we can enhance the model's ability to make accurate predictions based on the historical behavior of the target variable.\n","\n","### Rolling Features\n","\n","Rolling features, also known as rolling statistics or moving averages, involve calculating aggregate statistics over a rolling window of time. These features provide a smoothed representation of the data and can capture trends, fluctuations, or changes in the variable over time.\n","\n","In the context of Walmart sales data, we can calculate rolling features such as rolling mean, rolling median, or rolling sum. For example, we can calculate the 7-day rolling mean of sales, which gives us the average sales over the past week at each time point. Similarly, we can calculate the rolling sum or median over different time windows.\n","\n","Rolling features help to reduce noise and highlight underlying trends or patterns in the data. They provide a more stable representation of the variable by smoothing out short-term fluctuations or outliers. These features can be valuable in capturing long-term trends or seasonality in the sales data.\n","\n","In the upcoming sections, we will demonstrate how to create lag features and rolling features using the Walmart sales dataset.
