Workshop on Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series Data: A Case Study on Walmart Sales Forecasting Using M5 Dataset
Welcome to this workshop on Machine Learning with Time Series Data. We will be using the M5 Forecasting - Accuracy dataset from Kaggle, which represents unit sales data segregated by product categories in various Walmart outlets. This workshop is intended for researchers across the University of Central Florida.

This workshop is divided into five modules, each focusing on different aspects of Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis:

Introduction to Dataset and Time Series Data
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Preparation and Preprocessing
Model Training
Prediction and Evaluation
By the end of this workshop, you will have a clear understanding of how to handle time series data and how to apply machine learning models to make predictions based on that data.
